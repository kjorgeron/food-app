To implement monthly payments for your app, there are several legal and practical considerations to ensure compliance and protect both your business and your users. Here's a breakdown:

1. Payment Processing Compliance
PCI DSS Compliance: If you handle credit card payments, you must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) to protect user payment information.

Third-Party Payment Processors: Consider using services like Stripe, PayPal, or Apple Pay, which handle compliance and security for you.

2. Subscription Billing Laws
Clear Terms: Clearly outline the subscription terms, including the $6.99 monthly fee, cancellation policy, and any additional charges.

Automatic Renewal Disclosure: Many jurisdictions require you to inform users about automatic renewals and obtain explicit consent.

Refund Policies: Define and communicate your refund policy to users.

3. Privacy and Data Protection
Privacy Policy: Create a privacy policy that explains how you collect, store, and use user data. This is required by laws like GDPR (EU) and CCPA (California).

Data Security: Implement strong security measures to protect user data, especially payment information.

4. App Store Requirements
If your app is distributed through platforms like the Apple App Store or Google Play Store:

Follow their guidelines for in-app purchases and subscriptions.

Be aware of their revenue-sharing models (e.g., Apple and Google typically take a 15-30% cut of subscription revenue).

5. Tax Compliance
Sales Tax: Determine if your app is subject to sales tax or VAT in the regions where it operates. Services like TaxJar or Avalara can help automate this.

International Taxes: If you have users in multiple countries, ensure compliance with local tax laws.

6. Consumer Protection Laws
Free Trials: If you offer free trials, ensure users are informed about when they will be charged after the trial ends.

Cancellation Process: Make it easy for users to cancel their subscriptions to comply with consumer protection laws.

7. Intellectual Property
Ensure that all content in your app (e.g., recipes, images, code) is either original, licensed, or used with permission to avoid copyright issues.

8. Legal Agreements
Terms of Service: Draft a Terms of Service agreement that outlines user rights, responsibilities, and limitations of liability.

End-User License Agreement (EULA): If applicable, include an EULA to govern how users can use your app.
